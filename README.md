# countingSort
a new model other than the comparsion model 
but it takes only integers with rang from 0 to k
it's very fast if the the range is small. it's time complexity O(n + k).
it's stable algorithm.(numbers with the same value appear in the output array in the same order as they do in the array)
this property is very impoertant. it's often uesd as a subtoutine in radix sort.
